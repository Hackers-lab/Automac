      </p>
	<h3>Q: Can I filter the data based on multiple criteria simultaneously?</h3>
<p>
  Yes, you can apply multiple filter criteria at the same time. Simply select the desired options from the dropdown lists and enter the corresponding values in the input fields. The application will apply all the selected filters to narrow down the data set accordingly.
</p>
<h3>Q: How long does it take to process the filtering operation?</h3>
<p>
  The processing time depends on the size of the disconnection file and the complexity of the selected filter criteria. For small to medium-sized files, the operation is usually completed within a few seconds. However, larger files with extensive filtering requirements may take longer to process. Please be patient while the application analyzes and filters the data.
</p>
<h3>Q: Can I cancel or abort the filtering operation once it's initiated?</h3>
<p>
  Currently, the DCRC Automac V1.01 does not provide a built-in cancel or abort feature for the filtering operation. Once the filters are applied, it's recommended to wait for the operation to complete. However, if you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior, you can close the application and restart it.
</p>
<h3>Q: Are the filter settings saved between sessions?</h3>
<p>
  No, the application does not save the filter settings between sessions. Each time you open the DCRC Automac V1.01, you'll need to reselect the agency, enter the desired amount, and choose the class for filtering. This design ensures that you have control over the filtering process and allows flexibility when working with different data sets.
</p>
<h3>Q: Is there a limit on the number of records that can be filtered?</h3>
<p>
  The application can handle a large number of records, but there might be practical limitations based on your computer's resources. Filtering a very large dataset could require significant memory and processing power. If you experience any performance issues or if the application becomes unresponsive, consider filtering the data in smaller batches or optimizing your filter criteria to reduce the number of records processed at once.
</p>
<h3>Q: Can I undo or revert the applied filters?</h3>
<p>
  Currently, the application does not support an undo or revert feature for the applied filters. To remove the applied filters and view the complete dataset, you can close the DCRC Automac V1.01 and reopen it without selecting any filter criteria.
</p>
<h3>Q: How can I update the application to a newer version?</h3>
<p>
  To update the DCRC Automac application to a newer version, please follow these steps:

  <li>Download the latest version of the DCRC Automac setup file.</li>
  <li>Run the downloaded setup file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the newer version.</li>

These shortcuts can be used within the application's input fields and menus.
</p>
<h3>Q: Can I customize the appearance or theme of the DCRC Automac interface?</h3>
<p>
  The DCRC Automac V1.01 does not offer built-in customization options for the interface appearance or theme. The application uses a default styling consistent with the operating system's design guidelines. However, you can modify the application's CSS file (style.css) to customize the appearance according to your preferences. Keep in mind that any modifications to the CSS file may require a basic understanding of CSS rules and selectors.
</p>
<h3>Q: Does the application support multiple languages?</h3>
<p>
  Currently, the DCRC Automac V1.01 is available only in English. The application's user interface, error messages, and help documentation are presented in English. However, you can translate the application into other languages by modifying the text content within the HTML files. Please note that this requires manual translation and adjustment of all text elements throughout the application.
</p>
<h3>Q: Can I print the filtered results directly from the application?</h3>
<p>
  Yes, you can print the filtered results directly from the DCRC Automac V1.01 application. Once you have applied the desired filters and the results are displayed, you can use the print functionality of your web browser to print the page. Press Ctrl+P (or Command+P on Mac) to open the print dialog, review the print settings, and click the "Print" button to generate a physical or digital copy of the filtered results.
</p>
<h3>Q: How do I clear the search input fields and reset the filter criteria?</h3>
<p>
  To clear the search input fields and reset the filter criteria, click on the "Reset" button located near the filter options. This action will clear all the entered values and reset the dropdown lists to their default selections. The application will revert to the initial state, allowing you to apply new filter criteria or perform a fresh search.
</p>
<h3>Q: Can I filter the data based on multiple agencies simultaneously?</h3>
<p>
  No, the DCRC Automac V1.01 supports filtering the data for a single agency at a time. You can select one agency from the dropdown list to filter the disconnection records specific to that agency. If you need to filter data for multiple agencies, you can repeat the filtering process for each agency separately.
</p>
<h3>Q: How can I sort the filtered results?</h3>
<p>
  Currently, the DCRC Automac V1.01 does not provide built-in sorting functionality for the filtered results. The application displays the filtered records in the order they appear in the original disconnection file. However, you can export the filtered results to an Excel file and use Excel's sorting features to arrange the data based on specific columns.
</p>
<h3>Q: Is there a way to save the filter settings for future use?</h3>
<p>
  The DCRC Automac V1.01 does not have a built-in feature to save filter settings for future use. However, you can manually record the filter criteria you used by taking screenshots or writing them down. This way, you can refer back to your preferred filter settings when you reopen the application.
</p>
<h3>Q: Can I customize the columns displayed in the filtered results?</h3>
<p>
  Currently, the DCRC Automac V1.01 does not provide customization options for the columns displayed in the filtered results. The application shows a predefined set of columns based on the disconnection file's structure. If you need specific columns or additional information, consider exporting the filtered results to an Excel file and customizing the columns within Excel.
</p>
